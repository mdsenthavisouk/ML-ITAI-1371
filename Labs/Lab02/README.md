# Lab02: Tools used in Machine Learning

## What I Did
- Set up environments: Created notebooks in Colab (no install needed), local Jupyter (pip install jupyter), VS Code (extensions for Python/Jupyter).
- Initialized GitHub repo: Created public repo, added .gitignore, committed initial notebook.

## What I Learned
- Libraries: Pandas/NumPy foundational for data wrangling; Matplotlib reveals insights visually—streamlines ML from raw data to models.
- GitHub: Version control tracks progress; public repos build portfolios, fostering open-source mindset.

## Challenges
- GitHub setup; public access test in incognito—reflected on privacy vs sharing, emphasizing professionalism.
- Library imports; version mismatches—learned dependency management via requirements.txt for consistency.
- Markdown nuances; formatting links/images—challenged creativity, appreciated its power for clear communication in tech.
