# Lab03: Machine Learning Workflow & Types of Learning

## What I Did
- Reviewed workflow: Data collection/preprocessing, model selection/training, evaluation, deployment
- Built first classification model on sample dataset (e.g., Iris; features like sepal length; target species).
- Handled data types: Numerical (scaling), categorical (encoding), text (tokenization), images (resizing).
- Applied end-to-end: Loaded data, trained/evaluated model (accuracy), visualized insights.
  
## What I Learned
- Supervised uses X/y for predictions; unsupervised finds structures; reinforcement optimizes via trial-error.
- Simple classifiers like KNN reveal feature importance and overfitting risks.
- Proper preprocessing (e.g., one-hot for categories) prevents errors and boosts accuracy. Metrics like accuracy/F1 guide improvements, tying to real applications.
  
## Challenges
- Workflow steps; sequencing preprocessing before training—challenged by data quality issues, learned iteration key.
- First model; basic errors like unscaled features—overcame with debugging, emphasizing fundamentals.
