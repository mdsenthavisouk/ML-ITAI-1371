My name is Michael Senthavisouk and this is for my Intro to Machine Learning Class.
Im enrolled at Houston Community College, taking this class in the Fall of 2025. I was excited to take this class and learn more and gain nuance in my understanding of A.I.
I completed all Labs assigned this semester and learned a great deal about how Machine learning is used in A.I.
